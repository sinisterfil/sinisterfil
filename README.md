## Hatice Eslem Bayram

Software Engineering 3rd year student.

I enjoy working on projects that require analytical thinking, structured problem
solving, and a deep understanding of how software systems operate end-to-end.
My repositories mostly reflect hands-on learning in low-level programming,
concurrency, and algorithmic problem solving.

Currently focused on improving my skills through academic coursework,
team-based engineering projects, and continuous experimentation.
